# ![Assessment 1][banner]

This repository can be forked for [**assessment 1**][a1] of [Frontend 3][fe3]
at [**@CMDA**][cmda].

## TODO

*   [ ] [GitHub Pages](#github-pages)
*   [ ] [Metadata](#metadata)
*   [ ] [Workflow](#workflow)
*   [ ] Replace this document in your fork with your own readme!

## GitHub Pages

Set up [GitHub Pages][pages] for this fork through the **Settings** pane.  Use
the **Master branch** as its source.

## Metadata

Edit the **description** and **url** of your repository.  Click on edit above
the green Clone or download button and fill in your correct information.

## Workflow

How you go about your project is up to you other than that it must meet the
given requirements.  The following steps may help to tackle this challenge
though.

###### Explore

Explore the [data][].  Make sense of the rows, columns, and what they contain.
Investigate interesting aspects and possible outcomes.  Figure out what type of
chart you want and sketch your visualisation.

List the features needed to make your chart work and make sure they match our
[rubric][].  For example, pie charts or donut charts often lack features needed
to get good grades in the **application of subject matter** category.  You must
compensate with other useful features to get a good grade in this case.

Pick the most enticing data and copy it to your fork.

###### Process

Describe the purpose and background of your visualisation in your forkâ€™s readme.
Portray your data and list the d3 features.

Start writing code.  Feel free to use example code found on the web but make
sure to include correct citations.  Use inline code comments to describe
anything of interest.  Donâ€™t forget to document your process.

###### Review

Finish up your readme and review your project.  Audit the code and docs.
Evaluate whether the project matches our [rubric][] and make changes where
needed.

Include anything youâ€™re particularly proud of and mention anything that was
exceptionally hard to accomplish in your readme to make sure lecturers donâ€™t
miss it!  ðŸŒŸ
